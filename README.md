# Weather App

This project is a frontend challenge proposed to us at The New Digital School with collaboration with U-Trust.

This was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Launching the App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

## Project Specs

This project uses **React + Redux** for state management, `axios` for fetching data and a very basic, albeit beginner, implementation of **component-based** design.

## Future Builds

I intend on refactoring this to utilise `styled-components` as well as to properly implement class-based and functional components when possible.
