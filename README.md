# Weather App

This project is a frontend challenge proposed to us at **The New Digital School** with collaboration with **U-Trust**.

To view the site, head on over at: [https://sopasdigital.github.io/tnds-utrust-frontend-challenge/](https://sopasdigital.github.io/tnds-utrust-frontend-challenge/)

This was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Launching the App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

## Project Specs

This project uses [react](https://reactjs.org/) + [redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management, `axios` for fetching data, [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)  for the weather API, and a very basic, albeit beginner, implementation of **component-based** design.

## Future Builds

I intend on refactoring this to utilise `styled-components` as well as to properly implement class-based and functional components when possible.
