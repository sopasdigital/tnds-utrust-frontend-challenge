# Weather App

This project is a frontend challenge proposed to us at **The New Digital School** in collaboration with **U-Trust**.

This was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Launching the App

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

## Project Specs

This project uses [react](https://reactjs.org/) + [redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management, `thunk` for more comprehensive state management if I do end up scaling this up further, `axios` for fetching data, [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) for the weather API, and `styled-components` for a very basic, albeit beginner, implementation of **component-based** design.

## Future Builds

I intend on further refactoring my app to have a much cleaner codebase. I'm also still trying to figure out how to properly host my app on GitHub pages. Right now, the local version works just fine, but when I upload it to GH Pages, it only shows a blank web document. There are no errors that hint on what I should fix.
